Settings

You will need to use your public and private oDesk API keys::

Simple example
---------------------
Some examples of using listed in the odesk/examples folder. 
Here is the simple example.

Initializing the client::

	client = odesk.Client(public_key, secret_key)

Shows the url to get frob from it after app authorization on odesk and getting redirect to callback::

    print client.auth.auth_url()
    
Waiting for inputing the frob::
    
    print "After that you should be redirected back to your app URL with " + \
          "additional ?frob= parameter"
    frob = raw_input('Enter frob: ') 

Authentication::

    auth_token, user = client.auth.get_token(frob)
    print "Authenticated user:"
    print user

Installation of new client already with token::

    client = odesk.Client(public_key, secret_key, auth_token)

Getting user's teamrooms::

    print client.team.get_teamrooms()
